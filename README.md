# Mokoko Island
This was one of my first bigger projects that I created in my free time. This is not a full game, just the first few scenes that I made for fun.
I sadly stopped working on this project, even though I spent a lot of time polishing the visuals and adding features.

## Features
- Fun Story (wasn't the main focus of the project)
- Text interactions with the world
  - Interact with objects for unique dialogue
  - Multiple ways to interact and some unique interactions
- Colorful terminal
- Customizable text speed
- Working save system, maybe?

## How to play
Currently there is no binary download and since this project was done in Visual Studio, thats pretty much the only way to build it right now.
Distribution was not the main focus of the project, it was mainly versioning and accessibility, but opening the solution and building should do the trick.
After that you can use keyboard inputs in the terminal when prompted. I recommend setting the text speed to fast, since the other two options are way to slow.

## Problems
I had no clear plan in mind when I started coding, which resulted in a messy code-base with features that weren't fully tested and had different styles.
The whole story system was not thought out properly, so I could'nt have really expanded it.
Over all, this would be very hard to extend, so if I were to upgrade this, I would need to rewrite it all from scratch.
